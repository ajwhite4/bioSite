                <p> Jon White Jr. was born and raised in Omaha, NE, the oldest of three brothers. Growing up,
                    he was active in Boy Scouts and Football in High School. In Boy Scouts, he was given the
                    nickname “Crazy Spider,” and the nickname has since stuck. After High School, he went to
                    the University of Wyoming, where he met his wife, Emily. They had a son named Austin.

                    Jon went through several interests over the years, from learning to play guitar on his own
                    then creating an eBay store where he focused primarily on antiques and military souvenirs.
                    He got hooked on the TV show Diggers on the National Geographic channel in 2014. Then, five 
                    years ago, one of Jon’s best friends added him to the “Detecting the Heartland” Facebook page.
                    A short time later he decided to buy himself a metal detector and try it out.

                <p>
                    Over time, Jon learned the best approaches to success, where researching the history of
                    land determines if there will be anything to find in that area. Doing this helps you
                    appreciate history, and he’s grown an appreciation and interest in cartography and collecting
                    old coins. He also loves that metal detecting helps clean the environment where they can
                    collect and recycle any trash they find. The mental exercise and light workout are just a
                    bonus, just like any items he finds.
                </p>            
                <p>Once Jon got enough experience, he started a YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CrazySpiderAdventures" 
                    target="_blank">Crazy Spider Adventures</a>, to share his experience with others. As he became a 
                    little more known in the metal detecting community <a href="https://www.minelab.com/" target="_blank">MineLab</a> 
                    offered Jon a position to be one of their Detexperts (social influencers). Detecting the 
                    Heartland leaders also made him an administrator for their Facebook page.

                    His favorite finds are a 1900-O Barber half-dollar, a late 1800s micro mosaic brooch from
                    Italy, and a Civil war breast and box plate. His favorite place he has been metal detecting
                    was at a small acreage in northern Iowa along the Minnesota border. However, he has a trip
                    to Alaska in July 2022 to detect some land next to land owned by TV stars Steve and Shawn
                    Pomrenke from the show Bering Sea Gold on National Geographic.

                    He loves working with the younger generation to share his experience and help them
                    understand the importance of metal detecting. He also enjoys being able to help people find
                    lost items, even helping law enforcement find evidence of crimes. In addition, metal detecting
                    has taught Jon a higher level of generosity by allowing him to give back to his local community, donating
                    equipment to new metal detectorists, and volunteering through Detecting the Heartland.
